#Profile Reader

This is an open-source project that will display the "Profile.txt" files generated by compiled Xojo applications when the "Profile Code" option is turned on.

This project is distributed AS-IS and no warranty of fitness for any particular purpose is expressed or implied. You may freely use or modify this project or any part of within as long as this notice or any other legal notice is left undisturbed.

You may distribute a modified version of this project as long as all modifications are clearly documented and accredited.

##Usage

Run the app and open a "Profile.txt" file generated by one of your Xojo-compile apps. The app will display the report in a useful manner, closely mimicking the way Xojo displays such a report within the IDE.

A file named "Profile.txt" will be renamed with the propert date and time as contained within the report.

As long as you leave the window open, it is self-updating. New reports will be automatically added to the list and deleted reports removed. You can also right-click to reveal or delete a report.
